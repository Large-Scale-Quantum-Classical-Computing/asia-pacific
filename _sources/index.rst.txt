Annual Workshop on Large Scale Quantum-Classical Computing (LSQCC)
##################################################################

Quantum computing has the potential to elevate heterogeneous high-performance 
computers to be able to tackle problems that are intractable for purely 
classical supercomputers. This requires the integration of quantum processing 
units (QPUs) into a heterogeneous classical compute infrastructure, 
which we refer to as the quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC) model. 
Achieving this requires multiple industries to work together and align 
their efforts to integrate the hardware and software, alike. 

In this workshop we will present state-of-the-art solutions that are used in today’s 
heterogeneous compute architecture. We will demonstrate how QPUs are integrated 
into the existing frameworks without having to reinvent already established 
high-performance computing ecosystem tools and we will showcase how hybrid 
quantum-classical algorithms and applications can directly benefit from such 
QCSC architectures. Taken all together we discuss how these interdisciplinary 
integration efforts pave the way to quantum advantage becoming a reality in the 
near future.
